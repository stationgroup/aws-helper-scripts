# _Amazon Web Services_ Helper Scripts
A set of scripts designed to ease the pain of working with _Amazon Web Services_ (EC2 and S3). [Based on _Sean Bannister's_ original](https://github.com/SeanBannister/aws-helper-scripts).

_If you're looking for the original version from _Sean_ it's in the [`1.x` branch](https://github.com/stationgroup/aws-helper-scripts/tree/1.x)._

## :book: Getting Started

The `awscli` that was included in your instance should be enough to get started.


## :floppy_disk: Install and Usage

Make a copy of the scripts and execute the appropriate one.

```
git clone https://github.com/stationgroup/aws-helper-scripts/
```

Change directories to the scripts: `cd aws-helper-scripts/bin`

Example usage:
```bash
aws-helper-scripts/bin/i-create-volume /dev/xvdf /ebs none 80
```

---

`i-create-volume` - Create an EBS Volume. Then call `i-attach-volume` to Attach, Format and Persistently Mount the EBS Volume

`i-attach-volume` - Attach, Format and Persistently Mount an EBS Volume

`ln-mv` - Move a directory to an EBS volume and symlink from the original location to the EBS location. If the EBS volume already contains the directory we're trying to move to it just delete the original directory and create a symlink.
